        The postpartum period, also known as the postnatal period or puerperium,
        is the time after childbirth when a woman's body, including her
        reproductive organs and hormonal levels, returns to a pre-pregnancy
        state. It generally lasts for six to eight weeks, but some changes can
        persist for up to six months. This period is crucial for both the
        mother's physical and mental well-being, as well as for the newborn's
        care and development.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are three distinct phases of the postnatal period;the
        <strong> acute phase</strong>, lasting for six to twelve hours after
        birth;the <strong> subacute phase</strong>, lasting six weeks; and the
        <strong>delayed phase</strong>, lasting up to six months.
